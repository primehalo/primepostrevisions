# Prime Post Revisions

## Synopsis

A phpBB 3.2/3.3 extension that keeps a revision history of all posts edits. These revisions can be viewed, deleted, and restored only by users with the necessary permissions. Other features include the ability to enable/disable for specific forums and auto-pruning to remove old revisions. These options are set on the page for editing forum settings in ACP. This extension can be used with phpBB 3.1.3+ but due to a change of how button icons are displayed between 3.1 and 3.2 the template styling won't match completely.

## Installation

1. Download the ZIP file.
2. Unzip and copy to the `ext` directory of your phpBB board so that you have `ext/primehalo/primepostrevisions.
3. Navigate in the ACP to `Customise -> Manage extensions`.
4. Look for `Prime Post Revisions` under the Disabled Extensions list, and click its `Enable` link.
